# Trash
This is a small command-line program that asks Finder to move files or folders to the trash.

## Usage
Move files or folders to the trash:
```shell
$ trash <path> [...]
```
Empty the trash:
```shell
$ trash -e
```

## Installation
Either manually clone and build like any other Xcode project.
Or, use Homebrew:
```shell
$ brew tap sunmix/tap
```
```shell
$ brew install sunmix/tap/trash
```
